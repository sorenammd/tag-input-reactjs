## Props

The TagInput component accepts the following props:

- `tags` (object): An object that contains the tags to be displayed and managed. The structure should be `{ [tagType]: [tags] }`.

- `name` (string): The type of tags to manage. This should correspond to the key in the `tags` object.

- `setTags` (function): A function to update the tags when they are modified. It should accept the updated tags in the same format as the `tags` prop.

- `error` (boolean, optional): A boolean value that can be used to indicate an error state. If set to `true`, the component will display a red border.

## Functionality

The TagInput component provides the following functionality:

- Tags can be added by typing text in the input field and pressing Enter or by separating tags with a comma.

- Existing tags can be removed by clicking the "Ã—" button next to the tag.

- The component can display an optional error state with a red border when the `error` prop is set to `true`.

## Styling

You can customize the styling of the TagInput component by modifying the CSS in your project. The component itself uses the "tagInputContainer" class for the main container and relies on CSS for styling.
